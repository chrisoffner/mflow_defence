# Adversarial Defences with Manifold-Learning Flows

This repository contains code by Claire Br√§uer, Pablo Robles Cervantes, Yufei Liu, and Chris Offner for a project that was done as part of the **Computational Intelligence Lab 2024** at ETH Zurich.

We investigate the effectiveness of manifold-learning normalizing flows (**[M-Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13913)**) as an adversarial defence method for existing classifiers. Our project aims to assess the extent to which projecting input samples onto the learned data manifold and shifting them towards regions of higher data likelihood can improve adversarial robustness. By utilising the manifold-learning capabilities of M-Flows, we explore a novel ap- proach to mitigating the impact of adversarial attacks on deep neural networks.
